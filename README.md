This is an assignment I wrote for CS335 in 2015 at UoA.

It deals with creating restful services for a blog application.
The classes for this that I wrote have 100% test coverage as a side effect of using TDD.

The project follows the Maven Lifecycle and is something I'm quite pleased with.

That being said, it won't be maintained from 1 Oct 2015 due to other assignments and projects that I need to work on :)
